Naptaker is a garage punk trio based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. Their unique
sound blends surf, psych, and post-punk with a pop sensibility. The
self-described "[surf trash][surf-trash]" rockers deliver their original songs with
reverb-riffing guitars, idiosyncratic vocal styling, groove-driven bass, and
bombastic drums. Their shows are high energy events that get the audience moving
and sweating. Though Naptaker approaches their craft with a sense of humor, they
are ardent and serious about their art, aiming to raise their profile in the
world of sounds.

Formed in July of 2012 by a chance meeting on Craig's List, founding members
Eric Bailey (guitar) and Sam Albers (bass) first began writing and jamming in
the basement of their St. Paul castle. After a few months of messing around and
the mysterious disappearance of their original drummer, they were forced to call
out to the Craig's List gods yet again, who answered with Preston Drum, a recent
transplant from the Charlotte, NC punk scene. He has played in many bands,
including The Pelicans, [Choke Their Rivers with Our Dead][ctrwod],
[Weekenders][weekenders] and [Kill Your Mules](kill-your-mules).
